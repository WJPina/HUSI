# hUSI
### We introduced the human universal senescence index (hUSI) into the quantification of senescence based on transcriptome profiles to identify senescent cells and categorize senescent subpopulations across different cell types. Senescence features were learned from comprehensive transcriptome profiles utilizing a One-Class Logistic Regression (OCLR) model. The scoring for each sample or cell is determined using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Senescence status can be further classified through the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
